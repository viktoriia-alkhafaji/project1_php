# project1_php
A website with a possibility to login, create articles, which can be sorted to categories. The website is written with PHP, design is made with Pure CSS framework.

I ran it with Open Server and database in PhpMyAdmin.
You need to import some tables from folder dump in your DB and change the password, username and/or db name in config/db.php file if necessary.
